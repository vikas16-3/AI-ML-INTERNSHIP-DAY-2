## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on understanding the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and various visualization techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data that might inform further predictive modeling.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Use visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
- Prepare insights for further machine learning tasks.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- [KaggleHub](https://pypi.org/project/kagglehub/)
